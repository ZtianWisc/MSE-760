# Projects
* AMM == Accurate Mass Matching: 
  to match mass spec MS1 result with database
* FCC == 
  Face Centered Cubic Cell: to simulate fcc type crystals and liquid with Monte Carlo simulation to obtain states information (e.g.     temperature, density, pressure...) and mechanicam properities (e.g. visgocity)
* DLAA == D,L Amino Acid: 
  to screen out d,l amino acid containing peptides from its counterpart via LC-MS
